Please note that although usage of property files for translation of UI labels is supported at the moment, 
it is deprecated and not recommended. All labels translations for de_DE were moved to the vitroUILabels_de_DE.n3 file. 
If you want to customize some of the UI labels please create the new file vitroUILabels_de_DE_x_YYY.n3 where YYY is an abbreviation
for your organization (from 3 to 8 letters, such as TIB, UQAM, TAMU, etc). The file should be located next to vitroUILabels_de_DE.n3.
Instructions how to create the new, or update the existing label you can find at the 
[wiki page](https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/VIVO/VIVO+Technical+Documentation)
